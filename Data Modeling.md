Data Modeling
======

Data Modeling is a process of converting business and user needs into structure for organizing data.

## Hyperedges
> A hyperedge is a connection between two or more vertices, or nodes, of a hypergraph.
> A hypergraph is a graph in which generalized edges (called hyperedges) may connect more than two nodes with discrete properties.

Hyperedge (or intermediary node) can be handled by creating a node that represents an intersection of other nodes at a particular time:
